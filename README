AD Sync - Command Line Utility to synchronise users from Active Directory    
           to an Alchemy Database. Users in the AlchemyUsers group are       
           identified. A folder is created in their name, and a db group     
           is created based on their login. The folder is then assigned      
           to the group. On the server, a Role is created, the db and group  
           is added, the user is added. All that is left to do is to enable  
           Integrated Security.
